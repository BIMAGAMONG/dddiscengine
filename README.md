# DOKI DOKI DISC ENGINE (DDDE) (CANCELLED/SCRAPPED)
[THIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH TEAM SALVATO OR DOKI DOKI LITERATURE CLUB!

DDDE is a visual novel engine made only for DDLC (kinda like a Psych Engine equivalent for DDLC). You can modify it to your liking (while still following [Team Salvato's IP guidelines](https://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines)) and make DDLC mods on it. It's aim is to hopefully make DDLC modding easier and break free from limitations of Ren'Py.

Reasons for scrapping this project:
- Demotivation to work on it + not proud of the code I wrote for it
- Lost interest in DDLC modding
- Unable to find developers (fueled my demotivation further)
